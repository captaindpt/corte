## Dome Controls

### ZooFans Circulation Fan (zoofans.com)

The knob labeled "ZooFans" controls the air circulation fans inside the dome. Settings from left to right:

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Off** | No circulation (can get stuffy) |
| **High** | Maximum air movement, feels cooler |
| **Low** | Gentle air movement, feels warmer |

**If members complain about temperature:**
- Too cold → Set to **Low** or **Off**
- Too warm/stuffy → Set to **High**

**Note:** This is NOT the dome inflation system. The inflation blowers run continuously and are not user-adjustable. Do not confuse this fan control with dome inflation equipment.
